                Hey there, here is some information about me:
                <br><br>
                <b>Academic</b><br> I am a 21 year old computer science major at SUNY New Paltz finishing my last semester of my Computer Science Degree.
                 Primarily, I am used to designing software in Java, however, I am always willing to learn more coding languages and discover new things 
                 in order to advance my computer science studies. For example, some of my more recent projects have been written in JavaScript,
                  HTML5 / CSS, and Python.
                <br><br>
                If you are curious as to any recent projects I have been working on I have begun to set up a page on this website dedicated to displaying my work. 
                Follow this link to my <a href="projectspage.html">Projects Page</a>.
                <br><br>
                <b>Hobbies</b><br> When I'm not working on assignments for classes you can find me doing a variety of different activities.
                I enjoy playing guitar, listening to music, hanging out with friends, playing video games, or out on the different hiking trails
                here in the hudson valley. On occasion I also tinker with my Arduino and the various parts I have to make different robots and such
                as passion projects. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Objective</b><br> In the future, I would like to become a computer programmer developing and designing different applications and
                software. Any job where I can apply my computer science knowledge would be a great job for me. 
                <br><br>
                For any further information on my career goals and/or technical skills please follow this link to the <a href="Resume - Matthew Morfea.pdf" target="_Blank">Resume Page</a>  of the website.
